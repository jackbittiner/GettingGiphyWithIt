## Getting Giphy With It

"A picture is worth a thousand words." - Fred R. Barnard, 1921

"A gif is worth way more than that!" - Jack Bittiner, 2017

Finding the right animated pictures on the internet is way too difficult, so I have decided to solve this vital problem with a simple solution. This app should query the Giphy API for any provided query, returning the result and showing it to the user.

### Have a go!

Begin by cloning this repo and entering it. Go to your command line, go to where you would like this project to
be, and then type in the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://jackbittiner@bitbucket.org/jackbittiner/gettinggiphywithit.git
$ cd GettingGiphyWithIt
```

Install Node (if you haven't already):
```
$ brew install node
```

Then install all dependencies for this app by running:
```
$ npm install
```

Then download xcode - (It's huge so make sure you have space!)

To run the app type the following in the root directory:
```
$ react-native run-ios
```

Wait a little while for it to load...
Wait a little longer...
A tiny bit more...

Then Voila! You should see something like this:

![PreSearch](./readme-img/presearch.png)

Type in the gifs you'd like to see.
If you need inspiration, I searched for Corgi Flop. These are the results:

![PostSearch](./readme-img/postsearch.png)

LOOK AT THAT FLOP!!!

## Successes

This is my first ever React-Native application. And I've only ever slightly touched React.js once before. And it totally works! It might not be the slickest app in the world, but it meets the spec and I'm proud of it!

## Struggles

I started off struggling to get my head around React and the flow of data, but I quickly got to grips with this. I did struggle a lot with Redux and I'm still not entirely confident with it yet. But this is due to the fact that I've never done it before. I know with more exposure to it, I'll definitely get better at it.

I typically Test-Drive everything that I code, but due to time restrictions, and the fact that I'd have to learn a new testing framework I decided against it this time. It made it very hard to debug sometimes as I wasn't sure where my app was breaking.

## What Next?

__Testing__: I want to learn how to Jest!

__Styling__: As you can see, there is very little styling incorporated into my app. With some more time I would love to make it look BEAUTIFUL!

__Other Features__: It's very good having an app that renders gifs for you, but that's the end of the app. What would I do with all these gifs??? So... I would create a sort of storyboard of gifs. You get to select a few different ones, then display them one by one for maybe a couple seconds each to create a magical animated story! Then share it with your buds! 'Why?', you ask. Why not, eh?

## Thank You!

Thank you for taking the time to go over this application! I hope it's up to scratch!
